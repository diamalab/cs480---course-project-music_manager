# Challenge
We would like to create a database to manage a music platform that would contain all kinds of data that a user requires.
The user will be able to find origins as well as explore related music.
We wanted to work on something related to music and settled on creating this database.


# Database description
Our database will house a collection of songs. Each song will have a unique ID, name, artist/artists, the number of streams, format, genre, duration, track number, and if applicable an album or mixtape.
The albums are going to be recognized by a unique ID, name, total duration, release date, genre, artists, producers, samples, and the number of songs it has used.
Every user has a unique username, age, playlists, artists following, albums liked, songs liked, and friends.
Each artist and producer will be described by a unique ID, genre, name, and has a list of their albums and songs.
The first intention is to give better and faster search results/recommendations.
The second intention is to allow a user to discover related music such as samples or music friends listen to.
Names of songs, albums, and artists can coincide with each other but will ultimately differ by some unique ID.
For example, an artist can have a song that has the same name as another artist/album.
The song ID is a combination of characters that include the name, genre, artist’s name, and album name.
